            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I am a current junior at the University of Michigan studying Information Analysis in the School of Information. Most of my free time since I was a kid was spent watching movies and television shows.
                I would watch a movie almost every weekend with my family, and that tradition continued throughout my primary and secondary education. It has been my most consistent "hobby," if you can even call it that.
                My appreciation for the entertainment industry has grown since then, and has made me want to attempt critical reviews of film and TV in hopes of understanding my passion better. This is my first foray into that. </p>

                        <h1>Last Round of the All Valley Tournament in The Karate Kid</h1>
                        <p>This was one of the first movies I had ever seen as a kid, and is what sparked my interest in cinema.</p>
                        <p>Even though it wasn't the perfectly written movie by any means, it introduced me to the concepts of scene framing, sound track composure, and impeccable story telling.</p>

                <p>"First Learn Stand, Then Learn Fly. Nature Rule, Daniel-san, Not Mine.‚Äù - Mr. Miyagi</p>
                <p>By and large, this quote by Daniel LaRusso's sensei is one of my favorites out of all films. The simplicity of it makes it relatively easy to resonate with everyone, and it is part of the reason why I consider the film to be one of the more thought-provoking movies I've ever seen.</p>
