        <h1>Get Out: A Counterfeit Post-Racial Era</h1>
        <div class="getoutp1">
        <p>Barack Obama’s entrance into American politics as one of the most influential men in the world brought about the notion that America was to enter a post-racialized society. In this fantasy, governing policy would be written in accordance with universalist ideologies, and the trauma of racial inequalities would be nothing more than a relic of the past. In Get Out, Jordan Peele presents a fictionally horrific take on how exactly post-racialism manifests in modern American society. The protagonist, Chris, is preyed on by a seemingly innocuous white family and must literally fight for his life to survive being physically commandeered by a white man. The plot of the film, while exaggerated for the purpose of making an acclaimed horror movie, can be extrapolated onto the way American society functions today. Get Out demonstrates through its exposure of the supposed “colorblindness” of white and liberal characters, the fetishization of black bodies, and the intense desire to physically pass as black that a postracial America never existed.</p>

        <p>Many of the white characters portrayed in Get Out can be described as liberal, with some being dubbed “colorblind” by others or through their actions. Seeing race isn’t an issue many characters in the film appear to outwardly have, but the very essence of colorblindness is to deny the value of race-conscious and anti-racist ideas. The beginning of the movie is framed by Chris having to accompany Rose, Chris’s girlfriend at the time, to her parent’s house. Chris becomes apprehensive to meet Rose’s parents because she had never told them that he was black. Rose, a character who is often portrayed as being race-oblivious during her interactions with Chris, responds to the situation by questioning Chris if they should even have to know he’s black. As a white liberal saying this, Rose suggests that her parents (and herself by proxy) see beyond the implications of racial narratives by way of a colorblind perspective. She also affirms her family’s ideological standpoint when she says her father “would’ve voted for Obama a third time if he could have…”, which she also hopes will soothe Chris’s concerns about entering a white family’s home and experiencing marginalization during his stay. Peele intends this to be the facade of the modern white liberal, as these groups who practice colorblindness or identify with post-racial liberalist ideas fail to recognize apparent differences and inequalities suffered by nonwhite people in America. </p>

        <div class="getoutp3">
        <p>The film doubles down on this by placing the large estate of the Armitage family in Upstate New York, reminding viewers that even affluent households in traditionally progressive areas can still be linked to the racist values of slavery and the exploitation of black people that were more common with the old South. The notion that the colorblindness of white people actually worsens and propels racial inequalities is supported by research too. Tim Wise, an antiracist essayist, described a study where the research “[suggested] that it is precisely when the racialized aspect of an issue or dispute is allowed to remain sublimated… that it tends to have the greatest ability to control people’s opinions and actions” (Wise). Meaning that the colorblindness that white people possess in the film and in modern America only serves to act as a barrier of ignorance against their own prejudices and uses of white supremacy. White liberalism can also be interpreted by its tendency to produce co-optation, in which people selectively incorporate activism but fail to get rid of longstanding values. In the case of the film, the case of Rose’s father’s acclamation for President Obama and his denouncement of Hitler’s Aryan race theory are veils for the Armitage family’s history of racist values and desire to achieve the athleticism of black people. Therefore, the white liberalism and colorblindness shown in the film suggest that the United States is far from free of racial discrimination.</p>
