            <div class="item1"><h1>Master of None’s “First Date”: A Modern Love Story</h1></div>
            <div class="item2">
                <p>Everyone has the innate desire to connect with someone, be it romantically or not. There’s a drive tucked away in every human being that fuels that need to build relationships with one another. It's what grounds us to our more animalistic predecessors. One would assume, that with the advent of long-distance communication and instant social gratification, that this primal need would easily be achieved. Instead, as Aziz Ansari masterfully showcases with his Netflix comedy Master of None, the introduction of easy-to-use dating apps has all but destroyed what made the human connection so unique.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="item3">
                <p>The show, centered around Dev Shah (Aziz Ansari), is a fluctuating account of an Indian-American’s life in New York City. During the previous season, Dev meandered through the city trying to develop his acting career, eventually dating a woman named Rachel for a significant amount of time. By the fourth episode of the second season, “First Date,” Dev has gotten no closer to finding the person he wants to be with for the rest of his life. Therefore, during this episode, we watch Dev advance through a series of peculiar dates arranged through a suspiciously Tinder-esque dating app.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="item4">
                <p>Acting as a foray into the modern first date, the episode begins with a callous portrayal of how people treat finding relationships in today’s age. Immediately, a slow crawl to the right reveals a funeral service, and by the end of the shot, we see a woman swiping on this dating app called “Love @ First Sight” during a speech commemorating this unnamed person’s death. It’s a direct way of divulging the brutal insensitivity of these social apps. She’s shown to be swiping every few seconds, taking an unreasonably short amount of time to judge these suitors. The cool grey tone of the lighting, along with the intense amount of black on the screen during this initial scene, creates an aura of frigid dread surrounding this app as the woman continues swiping like a zombie until she matches with our protagonist Dev.</p>

            <div class="item5"><h1>The Witcher Review</h1></div>
            <div class="item6">
                <p>At its core, The Witcher is just another fantasy tale of sorcerers, swords, kings, dragons, and everything in between. Lauren Hissrich’s creation, however, takes the traditional fantasy trope and spins it on its head through somewhat befuddled but painstakingly detailed world building. From the get-go, the titular character Geralt of Rivia, played by Henry Cavill who somehow looks more muscular than he did in Man of Steel, is seen fighting a gigantic spider-like creature called a kikimora. After Geralt slays the beast, he brings the carcass back to a small town where he understandably expects compensation.</p>
            </div>
            <div class ="item7">
                <p>But alas, the alderman’s daughter tactfully explains that the poster Geralt found had a bounty on a graveir, not a kikimora, indirectly explaining to viewers that witchers are monster hunters for hire and probably can’t read very well. Here’s where a significant issue of the series starts: it takes little time to explain its vast world beyond village folk in taverns crying out that a witcher has arrived. For some, the challenge of understanding the lore of The Witcher may seem enticing, but for others, it could be enough to turn them away. To put it plainly, this isn’t a fantasy show you should watch in the background while dealing with the responsibilities of reality.</p>
